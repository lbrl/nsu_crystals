# nsu_crystals
Devoted to study of new scintillation crystals produced at the NSU.

Basically we have a Caen ADC and Hamamatsu PMT with which we try to wrok around.

## Sctipt description

1. txt2tree.py --- converts txt waveform files to the root a file with a tree. The tree contains the array with a waveform, and some parameters of the waveform.
1. afina.py --- generates plots based on the tree produced by txt2tree.py.
2. eos.py --- fits waveforms.
1. show_root_wf.py --- show wave forms and fiting examples.
1. info_2017-12-27.txt --- an info file example.
